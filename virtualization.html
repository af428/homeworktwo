                <p>Virtualization is the technology that lets someone create useful IT services while using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It also allows a person to use a physical machine's full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.</p>
		<p>Virtualization’s widespread applicability helped reduce vendor lock-in and made it the foundation of cloud computing. It’s so prevalent across enterprises today that specialized virtualization management software is often needed to help keep track of it all.</p>
